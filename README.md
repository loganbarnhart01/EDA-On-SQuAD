# EDA-On-SQuAD

In this brief report I explore the Stanford Question Answer Dataset (SQuAD), both versions 1.1 and 2.0 - comparing any similarities and differences and speculating the possible uses for each. 

SQuAD is typically used as a downstream task to evaluate an NLP model's accuracy / how much it's learned.
